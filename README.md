- 👋 Hi, I’m @sterroso
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, mostly backend development, and recently I'm getting into frontend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on microservices projects, especially those that help me gain more experience and confidence with JavaScript.
- 📫 You might send me an e-mail to sergio dot terroso at the google's mail domain.
